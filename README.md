# Warmer and Cooler

I'm creating this game as an opportunity to practice coding, refactoring, and version control.

The game is based on a children's game, where Player 1 hides something, and Player 2 looks for it.

As Player 2 moves around the room, Player 1 one prompts them "Warmer" as they get closer to the hiding place, and "Cooler" as they get further away.

As kids get comfortable with the game, they get more creative with the prompts, saying things like "You're on fire!" or "You're an iceberg!"
